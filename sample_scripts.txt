Boy, theres more to do than just invent new scooters.  Yeah, I guess that. [The scene changes to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs entering Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob is seen carrying a big bag of jellyfish jellyfish jellyfish.]  Jellyfish! Jellyfish! Jellyfish! Jellyfish! [SpongeBob flies into the air and jellyfish fly out] Youve been in the air all day. Youve been in the air all day. Thats not to say that youve never been in the air, but that doesnt mean you dont have some air in the first place.  Well, Mr. Krabs, I think I know how to get out of here.  [laughs] Air.  Okay, Mr. Krabs, see you tomorrow. [laughs]  Air. [laughs]  Darn. I almost forgot. [shakes his spatula in his hand] [SpongeBob nervously places the spatula back in the head and goes back into his house. Mr. Krabs is now at the Krusty Krab. He goes backstage and gets out of the line with a giant ball of jellyfish slime. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are shocked. They wait in line for a while until they are finally fed and given a jar of jellyfish slime.]  Mmm, jellyfish slime! [The scene changes to SpongeBob tying his jellyfish slime ball and then tying himself in a knot.]  Mmm, a little glue. [tosses the jellyfish slime ball over his tongue] [SpongeBob continues to toss the jellyfish slime ball in the line. Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are shocked to see that they are now jellyfish slime.]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no! [clings onto the jellyfish slime ball in the knot] No, no, no, no! [SpongeBob continues to throw the jellyfish slime ball in the line. But a jellyfish comes and takes the jellyfish out of the line. The scene changes to SpongeBob tying his jellyfish slime ball with a stick, then on top of a building, then on a hill where people are waiting for their money. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are shocked to see that the place where they were tied up was the right direction. SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs are shocked to see that the jellyfish came out of the right direction.]  Hey, you guys got the wrong jellyfish. [laughs]  Hey, you guys got the wrong jellyfish. [laughs]  [laughs] Let me guess. Its a Mega Jellyfish. [The jellyfish growl and swells up. Taking off his hat, SpongeBob puts it back on and hits the jellyfish on the head.]  [grabs the jellyfish] Oh, no, you dont. [laughs] [The scene changes to show a line of people waiting for their money. SpongeBob puts on his hat and hits the jellyfishs box-of-jellyfish.]  Ooh, I think I found it. [laughs] [The little jellyfish is sent packing. SpongeBob pulls out a net and holds out a jellyfish on a jellyfish box. He runs into Patrick, who is playing with his jellyfish.]  [laughs] [The little jellyfish lands on Patrick and pulls off his net. SpongeBob comes up with an idea.]  Well sculpt a statue of me in your likeness. [The little jellyfish sculpts the statue of himself in the sculpture of Patrick. The little jellyfish sculpts the statue of SpongeBob in the sculpture of Patrick. Then they both sculpt statues of their lairs. SpongeBob sculpts the lairs and Patrick the sculpts the lairs. They sculpt the entire building. SpongeBob and Patrick are then seen in the background.]  [chattering with pride] ♪Sign me up for this, little guy.♪ [The little jellyfish signs up for the little guys little lairs and they sit on top of the lairs.]  [sadly] ♪If youre good, we can go with the pink dress to the top of the stairs of the house.♪ [The little jellyfish sits on top of the pink dress. The little jellyfish sits on top of the pink jellyfish. The little jellyfish eats the little jellyfish and the little jellyfish is shown sleeping on top of the little jellyfishs bed.

[Mr. Krabs kicks his legs again] One...hour. [Mr. Krabs kicks his legs again] One...hour. [Squidward kicks Mr. Krabs face] One...hour.  [walks by the kitchen window] Can you believe it, Squidward? We did have a whole hour of my time? [Squidward is sitting at a table, eating his lunch. As Squidward talks, bubbles appear above his head]  Enjoy your lunch, little man!  [tired] Perfect. [walks up to the grill, and kicks his legs out of the grill, causing them to fly into the window] One...hour. [Mr. Krabs kicks his legs out again] One...hour. [Squidward kicks Mr. Krabs face, which covers his face. As Squidward talks, bubbles appear above his head]  [tired] Perfect. [gasps] Mr. Krabs, are you okay?  [sighs] Squidward, you were supposed to kick Mr. Krabs face, but he kicks his legs out, too!  [sighs] You mean when were gonna kick yours? [walks off his legs to the door] You never gonna see me from that side. [walks off his legs to the door, which hit his face on the toilet. Later, Mr. Krabs walks into the dining area, and is covered in mud. He then screams, grabs his face, and runs away. Later, Squidward is talking to SpongeBob]  You know, SpongeBob, there was this big misunderstanding.  No, no, no.  [sneezing on

[Both scream at the top of their lungs getting sucked into the Flying Dutchmans head. We hear a background of the ground shaking and the ground shaking again]  Hey, that was over before. Now Im gonna pretend Im not there. [Puts all his cards on the ground. Then he leans down] I hope its not a banana peel. [Turns to reveal his banana peel on his tongue] [SpongeBob takes it, and the banana peel dodges all around. Then he turns and goes back up to the Dutchmans head. Now, we see him running around and screaming. We then see him having an argument with the Flying Dutchman. We then hear a horn honking]  [running up to the Dutchmans head] Dutchman, take my helmet off! [Dutchman takes it off, but then it falls off]  [angrily] Do it! Do it, do it, do it! Do it, do it! Do it, do it! Do it, do it!  [sobbing] I cant take it off! [pants]  [screams] I cant take it off! [stomach growls]  [bawling] Now thats the creepin big deal. [speaking]  All right, Dutchman!

[shows his picture of SpongeBobs Flying Dutchman] And you put that balloon on the train, and the balloon... [lifts up his hand] floats! [Flying Dutchman looks like a rocket ship on a sunset. SpongeBob laughs. Scene changes to SpongeBob and the Flying Dutchman sitting on top of the train, in a goofy way]  Now that weve got ourselves a ticket, I could use a hand-out. [Flying Dutchman takes off his hat. SpongeBob takes it, then jumps up onto the platform, showing the ticket]  [gasps] Now, how do we get to the Krusty Krab?  Just do the left from the platform.  Left? [SpongeBob puts his left arm on the side of the platform, and then uses his right arm to move left] Right?

[pulls a pet doodlefish out of his pants] Pet doodlefish? [Kelpo gets so angry, he grabs onto the pet doodlefish, and begins biting on it. SpongeBob takes a peek inside himself] Oh, Im sorry, Kelpo!

We could be strong and strong and... strong. [SpongeBob and Patrick climb back into the Chum Bucket, while SpongeBob and Patrick are seen on the ground on a high-vis head-to-toe suit.

[SpongeBobs house knocks on the door, and Squidward answers it with SpongeBob]  Hi, SpongeBob.  Hey, Patrick, what are you doing?  Uhh, playing clarinet.

Just called to meet you, Mr. Tentacles. Welcome, little man. How nice to meet you.  [grunts, when he sees a horn honking] Oh, you know, Mr. Tentacles. Being a tiny snail, its not so bad.  Oh, thank you. You mustve heard this one. Smaller snails are naturally more attention-seeking.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. I forgot. [he notices something on his arm] What are you doing on my arm?  Nothing, [takes it off] its nothing.  Oh, wow. Does this mean youre not snails?  No, I mean no. Snails are not supposed to talk.  What do you mean?

Bob, I think this is it. Weve all had our fill of getting our picture taken by someone with a secret identity. [He climbs up the wall in disbelief, then smiles. Then he sees that there is only one thing he can do and that it will put him in jail for the rest of his life.]  Mr. Krabs!  Thank you, sir. [The two walk off, but the security guard walks up to the wall.]  [walks up to SpongeBob] You need this over here, dont you?  [While Mr. Krabs grunts and stammers] Uh...uh...  [While SpongeBob grunts and stammers] Oh, boy.  [While Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are pointing at each other] Okay... [While they are pointing at each other again] Im gonna need another picture. [The two walk away.]  [While Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob are pointing at each other again] Well, maybe we can work things out. [SpongeBob mentally prepares himself for jail, but is too tired to do it right yet.]  Mr. Krabs, please! I need more than one Krabby Patty. [He takes one of his two vegetables slices out of his pocket and puts it in front of his picture. He then takes two Krabby sticks from his belly button and puts them on his picture. He then takes two Krabby cups and puts them in front of his picture.]  Mr. Krabs, what are you doing?! [He jumps into the cell and gets out and starts crying.]  [crying] Oh, Krabs!  Mr. Krabs! Youre acting like youve been a victim of some horrible accident! I cant take it! I know its you, SpongeBob!  No, Krabs. It was accident! [The two sit back down and begin to cry. The other prisoners walks over to SpongeBob.]  [chuckles nervously] Oh, well, seeing as youve been in worse accident than this. [The scene changes to SpongeBob running through a trap set by the two prisoners.]  [While crying] Krabs! [The two prisoners grab for SpongeBob. The trap door wobbles and falls.

In the end, Squidward didnt make it. Ill never get the secret formula. [Squidward puts on the disguise and walks into the kitchen of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob comes out with a plate full of Krabby Patties.]  Order up! [Squidward places the Krabby Patties on the chairs and begins his work. Just then, something weird happens.  Ah, the Krabby Patty goes into SpongeBobs mouth. SpongeBob screams and runs around the kitchen. He and Patrick are screaming.]  SpongeBob, what happened? [SpongeBob runs into the bathroom and looks for the secret formula.]  Oh, I dont know, Squidward. What happened? [SpongeBob looks in the kitchen and sees that the secret formula is in the Krabby Patty.]  Oh, no. The secret formula just said, "Put the order here." [SpongeBob screams and jumps out of the bathroom, running around in circles in the background.]  Oh, no. [SpongeBob swerves around the inside of the kitchen, almost accidentally opening it. Squidward screams and runs out of the kitchen. SpongeBob comes back out with the formula and runs into the kitchen, crying. Squidward puts the whole ordeal to bed, but SpongeBob keeps on running around crying.]  [wakes up] Huh? [Squidward continues to run around crying. He hears some snoring and goes to look for the secret formula.]  Oh, no. The secret formula said, "Put the order here." [Squidward can hear the snoring from inside the kitchen. He hears a chattering noise and sees that it was from the Krabby Patty delivery man.]  Oh, no. The secret formula said, "Put the order here on the countertop." [Squidward gets the secret formula off his head. He walks into the kitchen and sees a stack of Krabby Patties on the countertop. He takes it out of his pocket and puts it on the chairs countertop. He glances at the patty on the plate.]  Oh, yeah. Uh, I may have put the order here, but its me own lucky number one fry cook secret formula. [laughs evilly] Oh, come on, boy. Lets go get the secret formula. [SpongeBob gets off the countertop and runs into the kitchen. The delivery man comes back out with the formula, along with a box of Krabby Patties on the countertop. Squidward runs to the door and gets the formula back, along with the box, but it comes out empty. Squidward rushes back in and tries to get the formula with a ladder, but Mr. Krabs is not there. He climbs down the countertop and gets the formula from the delivery man. He climbs on to the ladder to get up to the formula. He gets up, looking as if he is having a dream.]  [as he is getting his formula out of his body] Oh, uh, yeah. [Mr. Krabs sees that it is actually Squidward who is getting out of bed in the morning. He goes to check on Squidward.]  Oh, Eugene, can I go to work?  [pulls out a book] Sure. [Squidward grumbles and goes to get some of the secret formula, but comes out in the middle of the night. He writes his formula on the side of his skeleton and slithers home. The next morning, the secret formula is still in the Krabby Patty bowl, which Mr. Krabs opens and all the secret formula is there.]  Huh? [sees it and gasps] Where is it? [pushes the plate away and looks back at the table] Oh, no. [looks back up at the Chum Bucket] Mr. Krabs! Where is it? Is it here? The secret formula! Oh, Eugene, just look at this! Its precious! A puddle of pink liquid! [cries]  [wakes up] Ah, this is wonderful! [holds out his hand] Mr. Krabs, the secret formula.  If you want it, you gotta go find it. [puts the order in the register and goes back into the restaurant] [The scene changes to the Chum Bucket. Squidward is still in the office knitting and knitting until he sees the formula. He jumps up and takes a pencil and starts to write down the formula.]  Secret formula! Secret formula, sweety secret. [throws the pencil out and hugs the notebook] Ive got to go collect my secret formula! Secret formula, chum secret. [throws the pencil back and hugs the notebook again] Oh, chum secret. [throws the pencil out and hugs the notebook again] Oh, chum secret. [throws the pencil out and hugs the notebook again] Oh, chu—[gasps] secret! [sees

Bubble grab.  [spits out a ball of gum] Hey, I can see that! [stretches the ball]  [covers his lower lip] Thanks, SpongeBob. [laughs] [SpongeBob sighs and goes back to his desk. He looks at the chart again. The screen shows Johnny 2 earlier this week playing with his parents. He then takes a picture of SpongeBobs parents with a ruler. The chart shows them laughing and singing. SpongeBob takes the picture and laughs. Then he looks at the picture of his own two parents.]  [Points to the first picture] Mom, Dad, and/or [holds up his thumbs up] Uncle.  [shakes his thumb] Alright, lets see if these are alright. [laughs] [SpongeBob takes the second picture. The screen shows Johnny 2 earlier this Week 2. The first one showed up on the list. The second one showed up on the list but didnt show up until now. So, if you guys only had 6 pictures, youd have to make up the rest.  [annoyed] Mwa-ha-ha-ha! [laughs] [The screen shows the phone ringing and the clock rings again. SpongeBob takes the picture.]  [screams] Oh, no! [puts his thumb in the hole and shakes the glass] [The scene changes to SpongeBob and the parents at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is in the kitchen making a Krabby Patty. Nancy is in the dining area holding up a cleaning cup. Henry is in the ordering room. SpongeBob and the parents are all sitting in the aisle, waiting.]  [grunting as he is angry at what he is doing] Youre just gonna like a Krabby Patty tonight, huh? [cries]  [stretches his thumb out and sighs as he removes the cleaning cup] Ive never seen such a touching scene! [sniffles]  [gasps] Oh, Henry. Youre right! [Henry pulls down a rope and SpongeBob and the parents laugh. Henry gives SpongeBob and the parents a wedgie.]  And now, the wedgie. [places the rope on SpongeBob and the parents laugh]  [pulls down a cake stick] Henry, I dont think my thumb is all that good.  [laughs] Sorry.  [gives a thumbs up to both the rope and the wedgie] Okay, thats enough.  [stretches his thumb out and sighs] [The scene changes to SpongeBob and the parents at the Chum Bucket. SpongeBob is painting a picture of his thumb with the paintbrushes. Nancy is on the cleaning cup.]  Oh, hey, little duo! How are you thumb sausages?  [sniffles] [SpongeBob paints the other cheek with the paintbrushes. Nancy gives SpongeBob a thumbs up. The scene changes to Plankton and Karen in the ordering area. SpongeBob paints the other cheek with the paintbrushes and Karen gives Plankton a thumbs-up. SpongeBob and the parents eat their meals.]  [grilling and serving up Krabby Patties] Krabby Patties, Plankton! [SpongeBob dips his finger in the sauce. Karen holds up a Krabby Patty.]  [sighs] A very fine job, Mr. and Shelly. [kisses her patty] [Plankton makes his Krabby Patties. They are a little tight on the griddle, but they look delicious.]  [quickly preparing the patty] Patties are always a treat! [Plankton jams up some jam as the Krabby Patty comes out.]  [sarcastically] Oh, Karen, look at that! [The patty jam up.] [The patty falls on the griddle and comes out on a platter. The customers lick the entire thing and lick the whole thing goes up like a lawn sprinkler. The sauce comes out of the water as the Krabby Patty comes out.]  [southern accent] Ah, the perfect Krabby Patty! [The sauce comes out of the water and comes out on a platter. The customers lick the whole thing and lick the whole thing goes up like a lawn sprinkler. Suddenly, the customers run off laughing and cheering. Just then, Karen hears the sirens of the police and realizes that the Krabby Patty is indeed private property.]  [sniffles] Oh! Oh! My—my treedome! [laughs] [Plankton hops onto Karens lap and gets in her hair. She puts her glasses and nettles on to notice that the patty jam is gone. Karen notices that SpongeBob and the parents are singing "Happy Krusty Krab" while the alarm goes off.]  [starts crying] Oh, no!

Plankton and SpongeBob, the villains of "Mister Bubbles," arrive at the Chum Bucket with the formula. Plankton and SpongeBob, the villains of "F.U.N.L.N.D. Team," arrive with the formula. Meanwhile, in the library, Karen is snoring.]  There, there, old friend. You can sleep right at night. [turns page] [Karen is snoring until the light turns green. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is at the ordering boat.]  Order up, Plankton. Its time for you to go on vacation.

He pulls Squidward out of his head and squeezes him a third time. He pulls him back into his body.]  You know, Plankton, theres no arguing. Just look at this. [pulls out a calculator and shows it to Plankton] If I just subtracts up to ten, the formula will work! [laughs] Oh, heavens. [laughs as he pulls the lever to initiate flying]  All right, whip it up!

[Karen pulls him out again, Karen drops SpongeBob and picks him up. SpongeBob looks up and sees Karen laughing at him. Karens screen shows a picture of Karen with a picture of Karen on it.]  Oh, hey there, SpongeBob? You were right! I had no idea shes a woman. Oh, I know just what to do.

Bob and Patrick are now exhausted]  Well, its only a matter of hours until we hit Boss Dale.  Huh?  [stops and gasps] Boss Dale?!  Ah, he doesnt seem to be very happy about it.  [chuckles] The little guys seem a little concerned.  Well, I guess I cant go anywhere ever.  [teary-eyed] Well, see ya later, boss! [laughs] [The scene changes to nighttime. Patrick and the little guys are sneaking out of the Krusty Krab.]  Weve got to sneak behind the Krusty Krab to avoid getting hit by Dale’s sleigh.  So guess what? Dale is afraid of being hit by our sleds.  Yeah, the sleigh wont touch the Krusty Krab.  [confused] Dale? [The little guys notice that theyre floating in the sky above Bikini Bottom.]  Hmm? [The little guys see Dale floating in midair, floating up to the surface, and they scream. They start floating everywhere, with their holes all over the place. They start to go into another direction, and then the little guys hear that other little guys screaming. They start screaming again, and the sleigh starts spinning around and around until it disappears right in front of them.]  Uh, hey! Look out! [The little guys see a UFO flying by and are saved by it. The little folks furball their noses in and out of the planes.]  Hey, kid. Just a thought.

[The little girls scream and run away from the planes crash, just as the little guys scream and run away from the planes crashes. The little girls scream and run out of the plane, and the plane crashes right in front of them.]  [quietly] Whats happening, Billy?  We dont know. Hes in the cabin.  Well, we did see him fall and we think he might be in that sled. [The little girls run off, and the plane crashes right in front of them.]  Whew.  [The little girls run away, realizing that the planes missiles are still in the cabin. The planes missiles explode in the cabin as Billy screams. The little girls run out of the plane and it finally drives off. The plane crashes right in front of the little girls and they are now on their saddles. The little girls scream and run away completely scared, and the plane crashes right in front of them.]  [quietly] Whats happening to us?  [quietly] Weve got to find him. [The little girls find Billy and search all over as Billy is floating upward with the little girls. They run around in panic until a piece of Billy lands in the little girls hair. They run around in circles until a baby comes in and pops out.]  Yall got us an balloon.  [gets off the little girls hand] Aha! yall got us an antenna. [The little girls reach in their pockets and grab Billy and loop him up a dolly while the little guys do the same thing with their balloons. They throw Billy in the air and loop him up some more. Billy floats up to the hovercraft, where SpongeBob pops out.]  I gotcha!  [hits Billy in the head with the balloon] Gotcha!  [gets out of the hovercraft and puts the balloon on his head] Bon voyage, little one. [hops off the hovercraft] Bon voyage, little one. [hops into the balloon] [The little girls climb on to SpongeBob and continue their search for Billy. SpongeBob and the little girls keep climbing until one of the little girls slips on the little girls thumb.

[she opens the jar, and a giggle plays] Oh, Neptune, that was even better than that jar of peanut chocolate I just took. [she closes the door, and Gary walks into his house, sniffles] Gary? [opens the jar]  [screams, and spits out the peanut chocolate] Gary?! [SpongeBob gets up, desperate, and runs into his house, carrying the jar of chocolate. Gary comes back up, still crying] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob sees the peanut chocolate, looks in the jar, and pours it in a bucket. Then he puts his head in the bucket and starts eating the chocolate. Gary slithers towards SpongeBobs house, still crying] SpongeBobs right! [SpongeBob notices that some of the peanut chocolate is still in the bucket, so he takes it out. Then he puts the lid on the bucket, so that no

[both run to the door] You two are gonna make a great team, and Ill be the cornerstone of your new team.  Oh, I think I know what that means. [closes door. As he gasps, he sees a patty machine in the background. SpongeBob &amp; Patrick put their Krusty Krab hats on and prepare to serve the customers. Mr. Krabs is in his office making a Krusty Krab with the words "Team Member 1" on it. He hears a crash and looks around, then sees it is Mr. Krabs]  Owww, quit me, I cant stand it.

Dont be shy, SpongeBob. I was just talking to somebody else.  Me?  No. [laughs]  See you tomorrow.  [walks out and opens the door] See you tomorrow. [walks out and closes the door. He then closes the door. Then comes back in and shuts the door. He then enters a morgue]  What is that?  That body?  [walks out and sees a moronic Mr. Krabs] You cant see the crime, sir.  Oh, thats okay, its just that I have a little live wire on my back. Ill be right here with you. [walks into the morgue]  You have no idea what Im talking about? [pulls out a pair of
====================
Just like the real-life test, where youre faced with a choice between two equally valid reasons: one with an innocent face and one with evil face. [laughs]  Youll never get it.  Eh, I get it. I get it. I get it. [continues laughing]  Is there anything else I can do?  Umm... [makes a heart and lung to try and get the Krabby Patty but winds it up in his hand] Will you stop?  No, no! No, no, no- [Breathing heavily, he breathes heavily and then stops] No, no, no- [Coughs] No, no, no- [SpongeBobs breathing stops after a few seconds. Scene changes to SpongeBob in jail again, still laughing] No, no, no- [SpongeBob stops laughing and is eventually pulled out by Sheriff Johnson]  SpongeBob, is that any way to deal with an innocent face?  Yes, sir. [looks at his hands] Ah. I win. [Scene changes to outside jail. SpongeBob is put in the back of a truck, his clothes cuffed behind him then put into a cell where a wooden chair is put in a box until a metal box with a cork board comes out of it. SpongeBob sits there with his clothes cuffed. He is put in a small cell where a security guard is at. He is sitting there with his clothes cuffed. He makes a small voice with his head lowered.] Good morning, Mr. Warden Warden. Pleasure to be here, prisoner. [whimpers and shuts the door]  SpongeBob, are you all right, deputy?  Yes, deputy. I was just-  [sighs] I think I just need to take a shower.  Wash me, call me, text me, hang out with the ladies, read newspapers, eat Krabby Patties, eat my heart, drink up, think, think, think.  [thinking] Good thing Ive finally started. [SpongeBob looks out the window. The scene changes to SpongeBob sitting on a chair next to a metal box with a cork board. He is about to put his clothes in a small bowl when he is stopped by Sheriff Johnson. They both close the door as SpongeBob continues to blow on the bowl. The bowl wobbles as the big bubble of bubble soap pops. It is revealed that the bowl is empty.] I could use some more soap. [SpongeBob takes a deep breath and blows another bubble to form a nose. He blows a big nose out of the bowl and blows another big nose out. He blows another big nose out. He blows another big nose out. He blows another big nose out.] I can breathe fire again. [SpongeBob puts on his clothes and pretends to be sheriff. He comes out of the small bowl and blows another bubble. He pops and his clothes are all out. SpongeBob gasps.] Sheriff! [SpongeBob comes out of the bowl with his clothes on and looks at the jailers mug.]  Oh!  Now what are we going to do, deputy?  [confused] Im going back to jail to make some more stupid, old mug shots.  I dont have a mug anymore, thats why Im begging ya to put me in it.  Oh, I dont have a mug anymore. Im just a talking prisoner. [SpongeBob walks up to the two]  Who are you deputy?  [confused]  Sheriff? I dont wanna be a talking prisoner!  I dont wanna be a talking prisoner either!  [sadly] Oh, yeah. I would love to be a deputy again, just like I was.  Really?  Sure. Oh, yeah. [confused]  [smiles] Sheriff! [SpongeBob nods] Okay, SpongeBob, I think we all know the reason youre not in the Krusty Krab uniform. [he hands him his badge] Now go on in your new job. [SpongeBob looks down and sees a bunch of badges. He grunts in surprise, then growls at the top of his lungs] SpongeBob, what are these badges for?  Uh, deputy, I dont have a real license anymore.  What?  Uhh, um, for being a paid assassin. [SpongeBob looks at the badges he got from the assassin.] Youre on your way to completing your dangerous mission.  Oh, sure, lets go.  Im on my way to completing my dangerous mission. [the screen zooms over to the Krusty Krab]  Im on my way to completing my dangerous mission...Im on my way to completing my dangerous mission!  You have no idea what that is, dont you, deputy?  No. I dont need you, I can do whatever I want. Im just a paying customer
====================
Just a few more minutes of driving, SpongeBob.  Oh, Mr. Krabs, you have a fine automaker.  Fine automaker?  [rips off the fake mustache and speaks with a robotic voice] You mean youd let me down?  [laughs] Of course I do. I guess youll be the same. [closes door]  Mr. Krabs, you have a fine automaker. [shows him his machine]  [shocked] Me? Oh, okay. Youll have to drive me to get what you want.  Fine! Youll have to drive me to get the key to my door.  Idiot. [laughs] Youre much more than that. Youre the most buffoon of all.  I want to get away from you! [laughs, but then laughs] Okay, okay, okay. I got to keep my mouth shut. [opens door]  [gasps] SpongeBob, listen. Im so sorry I didnt hear you. [opens door wide] Squidward, you have to go in the back.  Im sorry, Mr. Krabs.  [gasps and closes door]  SpongeBob, no! [laughs] [SpongeBob drives the boat and then turns the boat around.]  Hurry up here, Squidward.  [opens door] What are you doing, SpongeBob?  Squidward, I was just doing my driving lesson.  [turns around] Oh, driving, huh?  Yeah. Like your [gasps] Amazing Grace... [gasps] Amazing Grace. [laughs]  [opens door] Ah, this is class. Every student takes a driving test. [SpongeBob takes a deep breath and swerves the boat upside-down.]  Now, thisll be easy if youre Patrick.  Oh, yeah. [gives a thumbs-up and drives off]  As long as you understand. [SpongeBob is driving and Squidward gives him a thumbs-up. SpongeBob gives Patrick a thumbs-up. Squidward drives the boat.]  Gee, is this anywhere close?  Oh, kind of the opposite. [Patrick opens his eyes and sees that SpongeBob is driving.]  Wow, Squidward, your driving chops is going way out. I wish I knew more about this. [Patrick takes the test and SpongeBob gives him a thumbs-up.]  Thisll be fun. [Patrick drives the boat.]  Oh, I am driving! [SpongeBob throws the steering wheel in the air and Patrick drives the boat. SpongeBob laughs. The boat then goes in and then the other boat lands in reverse. Patrick drives the boat upside-down.]  Gee, this is so funny. [Patrick laughs. SpongeBob walks in with a thumbs-up. He then gets a steering wheel and goes through the air in his boat.]  Wow, Squidward, the fun went from bad to worse. [Patrick opens his eyes and the boat goes in reverse. SpongeBob laughs and Patrick drives the boat.]  Gosh, Patrick, we almost got it. [SpongeBob and Patrick drive the boat around the sky and then drives the upside-down. They see a restaurant. They drive it to get their keys. Patrick drives it. SpongeBob and Patrick are driving the boat when they see a sign that says "Bubble Found". They drive through the sign and see a little boy in a crib.]  Hey, Little Boy. How are you doing?  [laughs] Oh, yeah, perfect. [laughs]  [laughs] Oh, you must be insane.  [laughs] Oh, you morons arent moronic. You could even be considerate. [Patrick opens his eyes. The sign says "Automatic Abandonment"]  [answers the other line] Oh, no Automatic Abandonment.  [takes off the steering wheel and talks in a low voice] What?  [normal voice] You dont see that on my driving training videos.  [normal voice] I know. Would you please tell me otherwise?  Pfft, tell it to the robot.  The robot. [laughs]  [laughs] Not the robot.  [laughs] Not the robot. [laughs] [SpongeBob laughs. Patrick opens his eyes. The sign says "Automatic Abandonment"]  Huh? [gasps as he sees a bunch of little boys in the crib] Where are you, little boys? [the little boys are driving the boat]  Oh, hey, little boys. You just stopped in front of [points] "Automatic Abandonment".  [screams] NO! I command you! [crashes into the wall, knocking out SpongeBobs smile. It turns out that Patrick crashed into the wall from the other side of the window, too. The little boys scream again. SpongeBob and
====================
Bubble Bass. I was born with a machine. It takes a little knowledge to make my machine.  [tosses his hat aside] You wouldnt happen to know the name, Bubble Bass.  Yeah. [A machine that looks like a submarine comes on screen and takes away the bubble bass. Then the scene cuts to the bubble bass holding a toy seal. SpongeBobs bubbles then pop. The scene cuts to the bubble bass with a bat]  I have learned to trust my bubble ears. Be with them when they are young, and the future of my business is mine. [bubble bass plays soothing note] [bubble bass plays soothing note again] [bubble bass starts to sing]  [screams] I think he finally does like his crabs. [the toy seal kisses them]  [happily] Mm-hmm. [bubble bass kisses them]  [the toy seal comes back and throws their possessions away, then he kisses them again] Oh, Bubble Bass... [the bubble bass hands them a piece of paper] I helped you find your bubble head. [he hands them the paper] You helped me find my bubble voice.  [the bubble bass is happy] You helped me become what I am today. [he then notices something surprising him. The bubble bass takes a pencil and sharpens a pencil sharp point on his face] Well, Im beginning to think that this is only going to get better. Besides, I-  [the bubble bass gets scared and drops the pencil] You dropped it?  [the bubble bass drops the pencil] No, not pencil sharpener point! [he drops the pencil] No sharpener point anywhere. [he drops the pencil again] It dropped on my face. [he drops the pencil] [the bubble bass walks up to a couple and begins to dance around]  [he pulls down the pencil sharpening point] I guess this is okay. [he pulls down the pencil sharpening point again and begins to talk nonsense] Ooh... [the bubble bass throws the pencil sharpener point at the bubble couple in a row before running off] Stay away from me! [the bubble bass throws the pencil sharpener point to another group of people, then runs off screaming] Youre not welcome on my show. [the scene cuts to the next day]  Have a nice visit, Bubble Bass. [the bubble bass walks off then comes back up to the stage and is wearing a visor and a bubble wig while wearing a bubble wig]  Well, Bubble Bass, I guess this is best over. [he walks off the stage, Bubble Bass breaks through the wall, and gets hit with a piece of the curtain, then he floats through a projector, and then we cut to him at the Krusty Krab, and we cut to him then at the stand, and we cut to him next to Mr. Krabs]  Well, now that SpongeBobs gone, maybe this time its gonna be different.  Oh, youre right. [he puts the curtain down and starts to sing nonsense] Okey-dokey, nonsense. [he is interrupted by the crashing of the boat, and we then see the boat completely destroyed, Bubble Bass crashes into a table, with our pans still on. The scene cuts back to the Krusty Krab]  All right, Krabs! Psst.  [screams] I ripped my face! [screams, and over the PA, Bubble Bass tries to steal the deed off the wall, by going over the speaker and then using the broken pieces of the PA as a lasso]  [singing nonsense] Cant leave without a replacement. [he goes over the speaker, and the camera zooms in on the PA, where a piece of the broken piece falls off, and we see the pieces of the broken PA falling off, as a sign of the show, is going off-screen]  [singing nonsense] Gotcha! [he is interrupted by the crashing of the boat, and we see the boat completely destroyed, Bubble Bass is then seen going over the barrel, with the barrel completely broken off, by Mr. Krabs]  What is going on here?  [screams] My bacon! My bacon! My bacon! [runs off the stage as the whole audience clings onto him, looks at him, and then jeers at him]  I guess I ripped my face, now. [he screams, and the entire building shakes, and he then proceeds to argue with the audience]  Hey, hey, hey! You dont know what fell on that balcony. [sprays a water cannon at him, and the whole place shakes]  [singing nonsense] Quit your rioting, you. Down with the past! Down with the past! [sprays a water cannon at him, and the whole building goes down as he continues to argue with
====================
SpongeBob tries to open door, but accidentally opens it, and Patrick, wearing the same disguise as SpongeBob, knocks him down. While Patrick is knocking, SpongeBobs body is made of some sort of material and, while knocking SpongeBob down, he opens the door, revealing his brain in it. The other brain brain is then broken pieces, and SpongeBob falls to the floor, still being knocked down. The scene changes to the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs comes in and is sweating. He looks at SpongeBob, who is still inside, and he mutters in anger. Mr. Krabs opens the door, revealing his brain inside him, and, while holding it, mutters in anger. Mr. Krabs closes the door, and the scene changes to Squidward, who is in his office, and looking out from the window, which shows a whole ship in the sky.]  I dont think that was a good plan, Mr. Krabs.  [gasps] You dont think that... SpongeBob... thats leaving us alone?  No. [shuts the door]  Well, maybe if we stayed here long enough, maybe we can find some other...  No, you dont think so? [points to the ship in the sky]  Is that... Oh, Neptune, its just a... [Barnacle Boy is shown leaning against the boat. He turns red and screams, then turns blue, screaming, then turns a shade of green to reveal him as a shade of green that only a dark-skinned person would normally wear, like a dark skin skin rug or shoe or a submarine, or even a skin tuxedo with eye patches on it. He turns to SpongeBob] Hey, look!  [pointing to the ship in the sky] It looks like theres someone on board. [the ship turns red, and screams. He turns back to normal]  [points to the ship in the sky] I wonder if we should... [the ship turns red, and screams. He turns back to normal]  [points to the ship in the sky] I wonder if we should... [the ship turns red, and screams. He turns back to normal]  [points to the ship in the sky] I wonder if we should... [the ship turns red, and screams. The ship turns green, and screams. He turns back to normal again. The ship continues to scream, and then suddenly, the ship turns green, and then screams, both simultaneously. The ship screams again and then Mr. Krabs shuts the door with his claw, and then we hear the ship screaming again. The ship turns green, and then screams again. The ship continues to scream, and then Mr. Krabs turns the light back on to green. SpongeBob and Patrick stand up, except for a plug, and then we see the log, now dark, and the ship, now awake. The ship screams, then the light turns back on to green. The ship then screams, and then Mr. Krabs turns the light back on to green. SpongeBob takes off the plug, and then we see the ship again screaming, and then Mr. Krabs turns the light back on to green. The ship then screams, and then SpongeBob turns green, and then the light then screams. They both scream, and then Mr. Krabs turns the light back on to green. The light then screams, and then the ship then screams, and then scream. Mr. Krabs shuts the door, and then we see the ship still screaming, and then Mr. Krabs turns the light back on to green. Then we see the ship still screaming, and then Mr. Krabs turns the light back on to green. We then see the ship still screaming, and then Mr. Krabs turns the light back on to green. We then see the ship still screaming, and then Mr. Krabs turns the light back on to green. We then see the ship still screaming, and then Mr. Krabs turns the light back on to green. We then see the ship still screaming, and then Mr. Krabs turns the light back on to green. We then see the ship still screaming, and then Mr. Krabs turns the light back on to green. And we see the ship still screaming and then Mr. Krabs turns the light back on to green. Mr. Krabs opens the door, and then the ship continues to scream. We see that the ship is still screaming, and then screams again. And then the ship continues to scream. And then the ship continues to scream. And then the ship continues to scream. And then the ship continues to scream. And then the ship continues to scream. And then the ship continues to scream. And then the ship continues to scream. And then the ship continues to scream.
