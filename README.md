## Sample result 1:

Sandy, you need to get that nut off my back. [shivering]

A nut?! [picks up a nut]

Thats not what I was talking about! [pulls the nut off his back]

Thats not what I meant by...  You got him!  [shivering]

Thats not what I meant! [hangs up the nut and pulls back the nut]

Thats not what I meant by... [stops and looks around]

Where is it? Where is it? Whats the big... [stops and looks around again]

...scam? Is it going on out here? [starts pulling out his back]

Thats not where... [the nut lands on Sandys hand]

Where is it? Thats not where.  Sandy, I dont think you should be doing that.

Sandy! You dont know what youre talking about.

Oh, Sandy, I know that this isnt what Im talking about.

Oh, thats okay. Its not like I dont know anything about nuttastic. [takes a deep breath]

Okay, Ill just take this. [takes the nut, puts it in a jar, and puts it in a blender]

[blends the nut, the blender, and the blender all talk at once]

Okay, this is it!  [in a trance]

Sandy, you didnt do a good job.  Im sorry, SpongeBob, but you failed again.  [in a deeper trance]

Sandy, did you hear that?  [jumps up and slams his face into a barrel]

You failed again.  [stops and turns around]

Okay, okay, Sandy, I know that. I just cant imagine what Im into all the time.  Im a nutcase.

[he jumps up and slams his face into the barrel]

Youre not. [jumps up on top of a barrel, picks up SpongeBob, and throws him]

You failed again.  Im a nutcase.  Patrick, what are you doing?

Im a nutcase.  I need to get a nut.  What are you doing? [jumps up on top of SpongeBob]

I need to get a big nut.  Patrick, I want to talk to you.

No, I dont want to talk to you. I want to talk to... [Patrick turns around, and turns around twice, turning SpongeBob around]

Patrick, you failed again.  Sandy! [starts knocking on the door, and Sandy comes in]

Look, I really am sorry for everything I did.  [hanging onto the barrel, shoving it down, and then banging on it]

Not only that, but you showed up late for work?  [crying]

My brain was working all night to make up for the hours I wasted on making up so much cheese.

[hanging on the barrel, then suddenly appearing] Patrick, what are you...

[Patrick turns around, and looks at him for his failure] Sandy?  [crying]

I know what you did to me brain. [turns around, and runs off the barrel. Sandy comes in again]

[screams] What the...? [gets up, exhausted]

Oh, Patrick, I got you something. [takes the nut off of SpongeBobs head]

Thats it. [takes the nut from SpongeBobs foot] Thats it. [takes the nut off his face. He chuckles, then sighs]

Thats the last nut I got. [walks away]  Patrick, maybe you can come back later.

Oh, sure, Im coming with you. [hangs up the barrel. Sandy walks into SpongeBobs house] [annoyed]

Nonsense, buddy. You let Gary go and enjoy his nice days alone. [puts her hat on her head]

You promise me? [she pulls it down, revealing a jar of chocolate]

You even let me sleep with you? [she opens the jar, and a giggle plays]

Oh, Neptune, that was even better than that jar of peanut chocolate I just took. [she closes the door, and Gary walks into his house, sniffles]

Gary? [opens the jar]  [screams, and spits out the peanut chocolate]

Gary?! [SpongeBob gets up, desperate, and runs into his house, carrying the jar of chocolate. Gary comes back up, still crying]

SpongeBob! [SpongeBob sees the peanut chocolate, looks in the jar, and pours it in a bucket. Then he puts his head in the bucket and starts eating the chocolate. Gary slithers towards SpongeBobs house, still crying]

SpongeBobs right! [SpongeBob notices that some of the peanut chocolate is still in the bucket, so he takes it out. Then he puts the lid on the bucket, so that no

## Sample result 2:

**Prompt**: [Spongebob is watching TV while Gary is playing with a rock.]

Peek-a-boo! [Gary and SpongeBob stop playing and start snoring.]

Meow.  [laughs]

[SpongeBob lifts the rock, but the rock starts going down. SpongeBob and Patrick get up.]

Oh, hey, guys. Just wanted to let you all have to- [Patrick gets up and takes out a leash.]

Can we go now?  Uh, dont worry. [SpongeBob and Patrick walk out of the restaurant.]  [laughs]

[Gary and SpongeBob stop in front of a billboard that says "Gary &amp; Patrick Snail Funeral Dining"; Patrick whimpers.]

[offscreen] Meow.  See you tomorrow. [walks out]

[Gary and SpongeBob walk in the sand.]

Gary, another goodbye. [walks out]

G-7! [gets hit by sand and is buried in sand]

Meow.  [laughs]

You and me in here, loathe each other. [cries and runs off while Patrick talks gibberish]

[picks up Gary and runs toward him] Gary, you morons should be ashamed. Snail prison is not for the sake of any punishment or sake of any length of my life.

[offscreen] N-1!  Oh, Patrick, if you think this is funny, I will tear you apart.  Oh, yeah, like that. [snorts]

No, no, really. It will be so much fun, we wont know what prison is.

[offscreen] Meow.  Theres no such thing as a proper punishment for such a disgusting display of pet ownership. [both laugh]

[runs off and jumps on Patrick] Come on, guys. [both laugh more]

[runs back and jumps on Squidward]

Hey, Squidward!  [holds on to a leash]

Stay inside so I wont get hurt. [holds on to a leash]

No, no, dont get hurt.  [holds on to a leash]

Okay, okay, okay, okay. [Garys eyes start to water up.]

[offscreen] M-1!  SpongeBob, Im your primary assistant

[Garys eyes are starting to water up.]

[SpongeBob holds on to a leash]

Okay, Gary, I can go. [goes inside the box and Garys eyes are watery-zy]

Come on, SpongeBob. [tries to open the box open to find it closed]

I can- [gasps] Oh, no. [gasps] Oh no. Oh no.

[opens the box and drops a bowl of cereal]

Oh no. Its closed. What is it?

[offscreen] Its... [gasps]

The box is... [the box is about to be opened] ...closed.

[offscreen] Oh, Gary, Ill never get out of here again. [Garys eyes are watery-zy again.]

[sighs]  [offscreen] Gary, what are you doing? Why... [groans and closes the box]

[offscreen] Meow.  [talks through his phone while holding on to a leash]

Well, this is it. [Garys eyes are still watery-zy.]

Meow?

Gary, I got to tell you something.

Meow?

Oh, yeah, you. Ive got to tell you something.

[offscreen] Meow.

[talks through his spatula while holding on to a leash]

Well, this is it. [Garys eyes are still watery-zy again.]

[talks through the ball of gum while holding on to an umbrella; he drops it on the ground and talks gibberish] [screams]

[Garys eyes are still watery-y again.]

[yelps and takes the umbrella] Oh, Gary, this is more trouble than it is worth.

[growls and sulks; he walks away]

[turns on the light]

Good thing I have this one.

[Gary does not turn on and is immediately dashed with dirt]

[Gary slithers through the mud. SpongeBob looks down and sees a trail of sludge. He turns and sees Patrick, who is sitting on a couch, looking at the screen with his eyes shut. Patrick walks up to SpongeBob and reveals some weird stuff about himself.]

[offscreen] Meow!

[Patrick lifts his head through the mud and shows a bunch of weird things on TV. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh. SpongeBob and Patrick continue laughing.]  [offscreen]

Meow!

[Patrick lifts his head through the mud and shows another strange trail of slime. They laugh at this.]

[offscreen] Meow! [Patrick shakes his head and shows a sample of the slime on the
