Youve been so busy, Ive... [Squidward turns invisible, sending the bus running.]  What?  I cant even see.  Oh, Squidward, I got it, I got it. Thats it! You came in the right way. You could have stopped at all this trouble. [SpongeBob and Patrick run off and Squidward jumps on the bus] Oh! [He disappears when the worm laughs. The worm runs up beside Squidward and walks out to the edge of the forest]  You can tell that the worm is going there. [The worm walks off toward the edge of the forest. Scene cuts to the worm hiding in the bushes. SpongeBob and Patrick look over to see the worm hiding in the bushes and the bus stopped. Squidward turns invisible, the bus gets lost. The worm screams and is chasing him.]  What? Why!? Why did you turn on that remote?!  Its the remote! You have to be in my way, Squidward♪ Now thats the end of the trip. Get lost, Squidward, youre in trouble.  Oh, thats a good one.  So be it. Ive decided I must be in your way. [Scene cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick in the bush next to the bush.]  Oh, Squidward, there you are. Were about to do some great deeds, but the worms had already decided to follow their will. [They run off in the bush to take their places at the spot where they fell. The worm looks behind them as SpongeBobs is still hiding in the bush. The bush falls and Squidward lands in the bush. The scene cuts to the worm holding Squidward in the bush. The worm lands in Squids shadow and gives him an ovation.]  I didnt think I could survive this.  But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.... [The worm gives Squidward a thumbs-down, then turns him invisible. The worm turns Squidwards face and gives him the thumbs-down.]  [thinking] Uh, Squidward, that... was so... strange.  [talking indistinguishably] Oh! I couldnt believe it! A worm! Well, you know a worm... [The worm stops talking. Squidward laughs angrily, and he turns out to be a new worm. Squidward laughs while flipping the switch on the bus.]  Well, Ill do it, Squidward. Ive got you covered now. [Squidward smiles smugly. At SpongeBobs laugh. SpongeBob and Patrick laugh too.]  Come on, I said it! [The bus pulls up while the snail is on the other side of the road. The snail is running along the highway.]  Well, I sure am a worm.  Oh. Ive had it all your life. [The snail flies and jumps in the passenger's truck and drives away.]  Well what if something...something...takes over my life? What if it takes his life!?  What if hes lost? [A snail flies back in the pickup truck and crashes into the bus. The driver notices the snail and gets scared. He walks up to it and puts it back in his truck.]  Youre not lost? Oh, you are. [The snail takes the driver to an empty bus stop and drives away.]  Oh, Squidward. I didnt think I would let one of you leave. It seems youre losing one of my friends here.  I want to be a worm, too.  [gul\n",

[the baby man pushes himself out of the pink cotton underwear while he takes a deep breathe] Im sure itll be fine.  [sings in deep breath. Then, he sees Patrick] What are you doing?  Im, I suppose, the baby. So, how many babies should we have here?  Well, Im here to have a baby.  Well, theres no need to thank me. Just wait til you find out.  Okay.

Here it is in this bottle: [glass with a label attached to it] A single-origin secret formula, a rare treat. [shows him the bottle] See? This formula is even more secret than before.  What are you talking about?  Youre talking about the ingredients.  Oh! The secret formula? Its locked up inside the bottle.  Locked? No.  Not if you keep it.  The bottle?  Yep. [SpongeBob laughs] It is now my mission to retrieve this secret formula. [cries]  The formula? [luminous light shines on his hand and SpongeBob cries]  Oh, oh, oh!

Take it back.  A special kind of tears us-- Oh, no, a special. Please. It is an item in its own right.  Oh, youre right, Krabs. A special. A very special item.  It is for me.

[gulps nervously] Its the Master Sponge, not a man. But my sworn duty is to bring the secret formula to the Krusty Krab. And youre my sworn authority to do that. [SpongeBob is heard on the other end of the phone]  Whoa! [SpongeBob turns on the light and the light turns off]  No! [the light turns off]  [turns on the light] The secret formula is safe inside!

SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs leave the Krusty Krab, with a lot of customers from the first wave arriving to leave. Mr. Krabs picks Plankton up and carries him away, and gives him the number five license plate], and goodbye.  Good-bye, SpongeBob. [gives Plankton the number 5 license plate] The Komedy Krab is known for being one of the fiercest foes the Krusty Krab has ever been plagued by.  [sighs] I never got so many orders out the way I thought they would one dime per person. [the customers murmur as they leave]  But, but we all knows its a dime!  It is?!  [laughs nervously] Oh, please, no more orders! Please! Please! Please! [Mr. Krabs pours patties into the cart and the customers complain.]  OOH, HOWEVER?! [takes a sample of the patty] This is so expensive...  [walks out] But not before getting the samples in a vase, eh, boy?  Um, excuse me, sir. How much do you want, you dummy?  [in a confident voice] Five bucks. [all the customers sign language] How about two?! [both mutters]  But, yes, sir! [Mr. Krabs takes out a sample glass]  [comes out of the glass and screams] What in Neptunes navel?! [he walks into the kitchen and sees all the customers crying. He sees SpongeBob, Squidward, and the fry cook] SpongeBob, Mr. Plankton, and Squidward: Im so sorry for what Mr. Krabs did! [crying]  Whatever.  No more customers. [all the customers gasps loudly and they stand up. Mr. Krabs grabs them and carries them aside to Squidward] Squidward, Mr. Krabs has taken me rightful place as fry cook! And now, I feel the wrath of my conscience! [SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and the other customers throw Squidward and the fry cook in the air] [The scene changes to SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward in jail, in a small cell]  [he is hiding under the mattress] Yes, conscience boy. [notices him] What are you doing in here?  You know the rule. I am free to go without violating any rules. You just have to follow my rules.  Oh, I really dont believe in free exercise of imagination.  [gets an idea] That Mr. Krabs means it!  [shocked and shocked] Im free?! [they both growl at each other] [SpongeBob is crying on the stand while Squidward looks on from the tears. Mr. Krabs puts the spatula down and holds his arm. As SpongeBob cries, Squidward stops crying.]  [he looks at his arm] That Mr. Krabs means it!  [stops crying] You know what? Dont you think Mr...  Mr. Krabs saying me? [tries taking the spatula but cannot take it] [SpongeBob puts some of his liquid through the spatula to form the Krabby Patty. The customers take a bite of the patty.]  Ah, it is good to be here. This is the last home of my faithful friend the Komedy Krab. [SpongeBob takes off the spatula, but Squidward takes it from him] So what do we do now? [slaps himself with the spatula] Well? [SpongeBob takes the patty from Squidward and slaps himself four times. Squidward screams in pain.]  SpongeBob! [SpongeBob grabs SpongeBob and ties him up to the chair.] Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. [cries]  Were going through with the search...  Im still here?  Im still here? [SpongeBob grabs two cameras]  Yup. [SpongeBob snaps himself out of SpongeBobs hands] So were finished! [SpongeBob screams as Squidward screams.]  [sighs] Okay, we all know what Krabby Patties are. But I knew I would do the opposite. [SpongeBob runs to the ordering window and yells over some of the food to start the Krabby Patties. When he reaches it, he screams in fear cause the Krabby Patties began to mold under the pressure. The molding happens right when Squidward and SpongeBob are about to eat the Krabby Patties]  That was close...but not today! [holds up his spatula that is still on] Im coming!

            " you, SpongeBob? And did you know the secret ingredient of the Krabby Patty? Its probably...  Uhh, I dont know. You need to get a couple of science-like drinks and a bottle of lemonade out of there, then it can be sorted out.  Oh, of course, sir. [they walk outside into the night. the fire fizzes and roars]  Wow, sounds like a pretty good plan...  Its actually quite interesting, Officer Bogusz.  You really think you know anything about explosives, arent you, fellow cop? Officer Bogusz? [cops officer puts a necklace with explosives in his waistband]  [laughs] I am going on 24 hours with no break. [opens the case and pulls out case with case inside, but drops bomb. police officer puts it in a glass container. The glass bottle falls down, hits the ceiling and closes the lid, breaking it, then they peek inside the case]  What are you doing with that, Officer?  What am I doing with? Theres no one around. [sees a door] Oh, but a door. This is it!  No, wait, I cant see it. [opens the door, and they both run out, while the clock strikes two, then see Sandy working on the case]  Okay, time for a quiet evening shift at the Krusty Krab. Sometime just need to be... [the alarm goes off and the Krabby Patty explodes. The damage to the Krusty Krab is total, with a sizzling pink background] destruction... [notices a piece of rubble covering the Krusty Krab] destruction... [checks the rubble and notices the rubble is gone] destruction... [gasps] destruction... [gasps] destruction... [the rubble begins to cover and cover, covering as the whole day passes by] destruction... [the rubble stops and the destroyed Krabby Patty begins to cover its tracks] all that matter... [the destroyed Krabby Patty continues to cover up every bit of rubble] no one would build this mess without a fight, would you...? [the remains of the Krabby Patty fall on the ground, leaving only the top half of its head and its skeleton] destruction... [the Krabby Patty falls on the ground, completely destroyed]  Huh? [screams] destruction... [the Krabby Patty disintegrates completely]  So now were all of... [The Krabby Patty explodes, obliterating the Krusty Krab. The scene changes to Sandy, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs in their respective police cruisers, with helmets and tear buckets looking at them]  [sniffs] Ohhh. Like that?  Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. Not after I retrieved the Krabby Patty formula.  [gasps] You failed again? [puts his police hat on his head] Im going undercover, [walks off] while Im at it. [Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward wave their police hats back and forth] Hahaha! [they both laugh]  And finally, [goes on a high-fives-high-fives-over-their costumes] Hahaha! [Sandy and Patrick walk off-screen, followed by SpongeBob and Patrick on the ground]  [waving their hands] destruction... [The destruction causes everyone in Bikini Bottom, including the dome, to become ashes, and all of them begin to cry. Then, a strange gas cloud appears, floats back to SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs] Destruction cloud. Willingly abounding in its foul power? Or will it soon boil under your dome? [the cloud floats back to them, and they float in the Krusty Krab]  [laughs] Those are some jokes I tell, Mr. Krabs.  I tell you what, Mr. Krabs. [the cloud returns to them]  And its working for us!  [laughs] That was one laugh.  Your turn! [cut to the Krusty Krab where one of the employees walks in]  Hooray!  What a quaint little establishment. Hey, everybody. Lets all come inside.  [crying] Im gonna stay cool. [SpongeBob and Patrick sigh and resume their work]  Well, in that case, whats with all the dinnertime feints? [he rubs his face in the glass of the cashier boat]  I was about to open a Krabby Patty, when... a horrible thunderstorm... forced me... to take shelter back in the kitchen... [he rips of the glass, revealing a badly sunburned SpongeBob] ...into the shadows and stay cool forever. [gasps as he sees Patricks frozen face in the glass] When I look back, SpongeBob and Patrick are lost. [\n",
