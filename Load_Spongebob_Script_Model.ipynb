But, in reality, it was actually just a guard worm.] Giant Hand Pies: Oh, yeah, thats the most realistic explanation I could think of. [laughs]  [screams] [The giant hand puppet looks horrified. The guard worm slithers down towards SpongeBob and grumbles in disgust. A part of SpongeBobs eye lands on the giant hand puppet eye. SpongeBob giggles and slithers off. He looks over and sees Gary.]  [screams] Gary!

[SpongeBob and Gary are both kicked out and pelted with water until they are up to no good. A yellow sponge comes in and whacks the guard worm with it. The guard worm slithers down to SpongeBob and whacks him with his umbrella.]  [gasps] Meow. [Garys slime trail leads him to the butterfly net.]  [sighs] I really have to get these things fixed. [The butterfly net tears in half and Gary slithers towards the giant hand puppet. The guard worm slithers towards SpongeBob.]  [gasps and slithers away] Oh, no. [picks up the giant hand puppet and laughs with it] My new net. [throws it away] [Gary slithers towards SpongeBob. He whacks the guard worm with his net. SpongeBob goes up to the giant hand puppet and sees a giant hand puppet version of Plankton.]  [wipes off his hand] Sorry, Gary, but my new net is completely harmless. [holds up a mirror] See?

The screen zooms back in to see Bubble Bass hiding in the closet again. He opens the closet door, but gets splattered with a bug! He screams and runs away.
